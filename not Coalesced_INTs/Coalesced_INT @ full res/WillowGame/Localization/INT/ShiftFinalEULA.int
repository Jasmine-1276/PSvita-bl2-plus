In any jurisdictions that limit certain exclusions or limitations of liability, Gearbox and its licensors will have their liability limited to the maximum extent permitted.<br/><br/>6. Indemnity<br/><br/>Players agree to hold harmless, indemnify, release and defend Gearbox, its licensors, employees, partners, affiliates and those authorized parties acting on Gearbox’s behalf (“partners”) from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and costs that arise as result of any Player’s use of the Licensed Works and/or any aspect of its implementation.

Continued use of the Licensed Works following such notification constitutes acceptance of any amendments. In the event that a Player disagrees with any amendment(s), his or her exclusive remedy will be to immediately discontinue using Licensed Works, in conjunction with any options made available in an applicable options menu.<br/><br/>8. Term<br/><br/>Players and Gearbox both have the right to terminate or cancel use of Licensed Works at any time, in tandem with any options made available in the applicable options menu.<br/><br/>The term of this Agreement will begin immediately upon Player’s initial use and will continue until terminated consistent with this Agreement.<br/><br/>9. Binding Arbitration & Class Action Waiver.<br/><br/>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS CONCERNING ANY DISPUTES REGARDING USE OF THE LICENSED WORKS BETWEEN YOU AND GEARBOX, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS.<br/><br/>(a) Dispute. As used in this agreement, “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, demand, action, proceeding, or other controversy between you and Gearbox concerning the Licensed Works, whether based in contract, warranty, tort (including, without limitation, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, concealment, omission, negligence, conversion, trespass, strict liability, and product liability), statute (including, without limitation, consumer protection and unfair competition statutes), regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis or theory. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.<br/><br/>(b) Informal Resolution Option. You and Gearbox agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute before commencing arbitration. Unless you and Gearbox otherwise agree in writing, the time for informal resolution will be 60 days from the date on which you or Gearbox mails a notice of the Dispute (“Notice of Dispute”) as specified in Section 9(c). You and Gearbox agree that neither party will commence arbitration before the end of the 60-day period provided for informal resolution.<br/><br/>(c) Dispute Notices. Notice of any Dispute with Gearbox regarding online use of the Licensed Works must be sent via e-mail to dispute@gearboxsoftware.com as well as by U.S. Mail to Gearbox Software, LLC, ATTN: LEGAL DEPT/ARBITRATION NOTICE, 101 East Park Blvd, Suite 1200, Plano, TX 75074, and must contain a written statement setting forth (i) your name, address, and contact information, (ii) your email address, (iii) the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and (d) the relief you seek. Notice of a Gearbox Dispute with you will be sent to your registered e-mail address and by U.S. Mail to the known mailing address.<br/><br/>(d) BINDING ARBITRATION. IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU AND GEARBOX AGREE THAT IF YOU AND GEARBOX DO NOT RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY INFORMAL NEGOTIATION UNDER SECTION 9(b) ABOVE, ANY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES IN SECTION 9(g) BELOW. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY OPTING TO USE THE LICENSED WORKS, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION WHICH FORFEITS ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. INSTEAD, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, WHOSE AWARD (DECISION) WILL BE BINDING AND FINAL, EXCEPT FOR A LIMITED RIGHT OF APPEAL UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. ANY COURT WITH JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES MAY ENFORCE THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD.<br/><br/>THE ONLY DISPUTES NOT COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO NEGOTIATE INFORMALLY AND ARBITRATE ARE DISPUTES ENFORCING, PROTECTING, OR CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF ANY OF YOUR OR GEARBOX’S (OR ANY OF YOUR OR GEARBOX’S LICENSORS’) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.<br/><br/>(e) Small Claims Option. Notwithstanding Section 9(d), you may also have the right to litigate any Dispute regarding your use of the Licensed Works in small claims court, subject to satisfying all requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the disputed amount at issue.<br/><br/>(f) CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU AND GEARBOX AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, IN COURT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT NEITHER YOU NOR GEARBOX WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, A COLLECTIVE ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY PROCEEDING IN WHICH YOU OR GEARBOX ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND GEARBOX FURTHER AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF YOU, GEARBOX, AND ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROECCEDING.<br/><br/>(g) Arbitration Procedure. The arbitration of any Dispute will be conducted by, and according to the rules and procedures of, the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). Information about the AAA, and how to commence arbitration before it, is available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA will govern the arbitration. If you are an individual consumer and use the Licensed Works for personal or household use, or if the value of the Dispute is $75,000 or less, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes of the AAA will also apply. If the AAA rules or procedures conflict with the provisions of this agreement, the provisions of this agreement will govern. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules and procedures. Where the value of a Dispute is $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to instead hold an in-person hearing.<br/><br/>(h) Arbitration Location. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Collin County, Texas. Gearbox agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence.<br/><br/>(i) Costs & Fees. In any arbitration you commence, Gearbox reserves its right to seek its expenses associated with the arbitration process. In a Dispute involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing and AAA administrative fees and arbitrator's fees and expenses. You and Gearbox agree that fees and expenses are not counted in determining how much a Dispute involves.<br/><br/>(j) Enforceability. If the class action waiver (which includes a waiver of private attorney-general actions) in Section 9(f) is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, whether by judicial, legislative, or other action, then this Section 9 and its subsections will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts of the Dispute will be severed and proceed in a Texas court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. The definition of “Dispute” in Section 9(a) will still apply to this agreement. You and Gearbox irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in Collin County, Texas, USA, for all proceedings in court under this Section 9(j).<br/><br/>(k) Rejection Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this contract, Gearbox agrees that if it makes a material change to this Section 9 (other than an administrative change or revision to the notice address in Section 9(c)) while you are authorized to use the Licensed Works, you may reject the change by sending Gearbox written notice within 30 days of the change by email to privacy@gearboxsoftware.com and via U.S. Mail to the address contained in Section 9(c). By rejecting the change, you agree that you will informally negotiate and arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the most recent version of this Section 9 prior to the change you rejected.<br/><br/>(l) Severability. If any provision of this Section 9 and its subsections, other than Section 9(f) (i.e., class action waiver), is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed from this Section 9, but the remainder will remain in full force and effect. Section 9(j) explains what happens if Section 9(f) is found to be illegal or unenforceable.<br/><br/>(m) Survival. The provisions of this Section 9 will survive termination of this agreement and the provision of the Licensed Works.<br/><br/>10. Interpretation<br/><br/>All parts of this agreement apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. In the event that a court hold a part of the agreement unenforceable as written, Gearbox shall have the exclusive right to replace the affected part with terms most closely matching the intent of what was originally written; the remainder of the agreement will only change in Gearbox’s discretion. Sections 9(j) and 9(l) explain what happens if parts of Section 9 (i.e., arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable. Sections 9(j) and 9(l) prevail over this Section 10 if inconsistent with this Section 10. This agreement represents the entire contract between you and Gearbox regarding your use of the Licensed Works, superseding any prior contract or oral or written statements regarding your use of the Licensed Works. The Section titles herein do not limit the other agreement terms.<br/><br/>11. Assignment & Transfer<br/><br/>Gearbox may assign, transfer, sell, rent or lend or otherwise dispose of its rights and obligations under this agreement, in whole or part, at any time without notice to you. Players may not assign this agreement in whole or in part, or any rights to use the Licensed Works or any part of the Licensed Works, either temporarily or permanently, to any other party, and any attempt to do so is void.<br/><br/>12. No Third Party Beneficiaries; Gearbox Affiliates<br/><br/>This agreement is solely for the benefit of Gearbox and Players, except for certain Sections which are for the benefit of Gearbox and its partners. As a result, only Gearbox and its partners may be authorized to enforce this agreement. Except as stated herein, this agreement does not create any enforceable rights by others.<br/><br/>13. No Waiver<br/><br/>Gearbox enforces this agreement and exercises its rights and remedies in Gearbox’s sole discretion. If we fail to enforce such rules, rights (or remedies in some instances), we do not waive our right to do so in other instances. These terms do not create any private right of action for you or any third party, nor do they create any reasonable expectation that a waiver of any right(s) has occurred.<br/><br/>14. One Year Filing Requirement<br/><br/>To the extent permitted by law, any claim or Dispute arising out of or relating to these terms and the Licensed Works must be filed within one year (a) in an arbitration proceeding under Section 9, (b) in small claims court, or (c) in court if Section 9 permits the Dispute to be filed in court instead of arbitration. The one-year period begins on the date when the claim or Dispute could first be filed; any claim or Dispute that is not filed by the Player within such time is waived and permanently barred.<br/><br/>15. Choice of Law<br/><br/>Players agree that this agreement was made and executed in the State of Texas, and that any related disputes will be governed by the laws of Texas; by opting to use the Licensed Works, Players consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts therein. Texas State law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to all claims, regardless of choice of law principles. Gearbox will be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses for any matter in which it prevails.%AMENDMENT%
