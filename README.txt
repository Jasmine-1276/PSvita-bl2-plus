hey this is my config. rename to Coalesced_INT.bin and place at ux0:app/pcse00383/willowgame/CookedNGP/. make sure to use vitagrafix with a matching fb size (ex 960x544 for full res). I also recommend using the framecapper plugin by rinne. This config is based on the tweakyblinders config by justalex95 (https://github.com/justalex95/Borderlands-2-Vita-TweakyBlinders-config). usually the fps is in between 27 - 30fps (capped). ty for downloading!!
